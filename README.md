# Shotgun
A quick game I made for ComputerCraft that is intended to emulate the common school game that is known by several names such as Shotgun, 007, and War.

The code is very, very messy and unoptimised. I'm sorry.
# Installation
Shotgun can be installed using wget:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atenfyr/shotgun/master/shotgun.lua shotgun`
