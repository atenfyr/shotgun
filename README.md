# Shotgun
A quick game I made for ComputerCraft that is intended to emulate the common schoolboy game known as "Shotgun" or "007".

The code is very, very messy and unoptimised. I'm sorry.
# Installation
Shotgun can be installed using wget:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atenfyr/shotgun/master/shotgun.lua shotgun`
